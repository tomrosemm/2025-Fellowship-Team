Simulates the invocation of a blockchain smart contract for ZKP-OTP verification and logs authentication events.

- Anonymizes vehicle IDs using hashing before logging.
- Simulates a smart contract call and logs the event with vehicle hash, timestamp, and authentication status.
- Returns the outcome to mimic infrastructure access control.
